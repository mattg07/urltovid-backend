To influence people, make one key change in how you talk, says communication expert Matt Abrahams. Asking questions can actually help you garner influence and change minds. It puts you in a position of power, raising your status while lowering that of the person being questioned. Good questions demonstrate care, empathy, and a willingness to learn, which are valuable assets for career growth and relationship building.

Effective leaders balance credibility with humility and a willingness to learn. However, not every question will help you get ahead. You need to know how, when, and why you’re asking to be more influential. Good questions are concise, build on what others have said, and revolve around a focused idea. Consider your intention before asking: Are you trying to show understanding, interest, or help someone see another perspective?

Practicing good questioning takes time. Start small and approach casual interactions like interviews. If your questions tend to ramble, use AI tools to help you phrase them concisely. Always listen before asking; this shows you’re engaged and invites collaboration, fostering long-term relationships.
