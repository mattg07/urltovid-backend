To influence people, make one key change in how you talk. Asking questions can actually help you garner influence and change minds. Communication expert Matt Abrahams explains that asking questions puts you in a position of power, demonstrating care and empathy. Good questions are concise, build on previous conversation, and focus on the topic's bottom line. Practice asking thoughtful questions to strengthen relationships and enhance your influence. Always listen first, as it shows you value the other person's input and fosters collaboration.
