Good questions are concise, build on previous conversation, and focus on the topic's bottom line. They can have multiple purposes but should be quick and clear. Consider your intention before asking: do you want to show understanding, interest, or help someone see another perspective? Avoid asking just for participation points; thoughtful questions are key to effective communication.
