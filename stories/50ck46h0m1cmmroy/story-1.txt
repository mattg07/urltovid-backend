The EU's tariffs on Chinese EVs, while a hurdle, are not a barrier to entry. With tariffs on models like BYD's Dolphin remaining competitive, the price difference compared to Western brands like Tesla is significant. For instance, even with a 17% tariff, BYD's model is still cheaper than Tesla's Model 3. This pricing strategy allows Chinese manufacturers to thrive in the European market, despite ongoing tariff discussions aimed at protecting local industries.
