Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) are set to maintain their competitive edge in Europe despite the EU's recent tariff adjustments. Analysts suggest that current tariffs, which have been slightly reduced, are insufficient to deter exports significantly. To effectively challenge Chinese EVs, tariffs would need to reach around 50%. The interconnectedness of European and Chinese manufacturers means that the EU's tariffs are less severe than those imposed by North America. As Chinese companies innovate with lower-cost models, the market dynamics continue to shift, posing challenges for European automakers.
