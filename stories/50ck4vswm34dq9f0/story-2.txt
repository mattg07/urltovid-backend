Effective questioning takes practice. Start small by treating casual interactions like interviews. Use tools like AI to refine your questions and seek feedback from trusted colleagues after important discussions. Listening is crucial; it shows you value the other person's input and encourages collaboration. This approach not only enhances your influence but also builds stronger relationships.
