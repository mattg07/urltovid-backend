To influence others, change how you ask questions. Communication expert Matt Abrahams emphasizes that asking questions can elevate your status and demonstrate empathy. Good questions are concise, build on previous dialogue, and focus on key ideas. They should be thoughtful, aiming to clarify or advance the conversation. Practice asking questions in casual settings, and always listen first to foster collaboration. This approach not only strengthens relationships but also enhances your influence in various aspects of life.
