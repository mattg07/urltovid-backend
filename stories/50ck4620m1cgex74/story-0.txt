Mercedes shares dropped over 6% after cutting its 2024 guidance, citing weak demand from China. The company now expects earnings before interest and taxes to be significantly below last year, with adjusted sales returns between 7.5% and 8.5%. This revision reflects a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, particularly in China, affecting overall sales volume. The auto sector faced a downturn, with other automakers like Volvo and Stellantis also seeing declines. Analysts noted that the scale of Mercedes' warning could raise concerns among investors about profitability going into 2025.
