To influence others, change how you ask questions. Communication expert Matt Abrahams emphasizes that asking questions can elevate your status and demonstrate empathy. Good questions are concise, build on previous dialogue, and focus on key ideas. Before asking, consider your intention—whether to show understanding or to guide the conversation. Practice asking questions in casual settings, and always listen first. This approach fosters collaboration and strengthens relationships.
