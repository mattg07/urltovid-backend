Good questions contain three key elements: they are concise, build on what others say, and focus on the main topic. This clarity helps keep the listener engaged. Abrahams advises against asking questions just for participation points; they should always be thoughtful and purposeful. Practicing in casual interactions can help refine your questioning skills and make you more influential in conversations.
