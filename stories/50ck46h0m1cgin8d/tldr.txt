To influence others, change how you ask questions. Communication expert Matt Abrahams emphasizes that asking questions can elevate your status and demonstrate empathy. Good questions should be concise, build on previous comments, and focus on the main idea. Practice asking thoughtful questions in casual interactions, and always listen first. This approach fosters collaboration and strengthens relationships, making you more influential in both personal and professional settings.
