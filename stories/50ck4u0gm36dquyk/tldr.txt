To influence others, consider changing how you ask questions. Communication expert Matt Abrahams emphasizes that asking questions can elevate your status and demonstrate empathy, care, and a willingness to learn. Effective leaders balance credibility with humility and know how to ask the right questions to strengthen relationships and advance their careers. 

Abrahams outlines three key elements of a good question: it should be concise, build on previous conversation points, and focus on a specific idea. Before asking, consider your intentionâ€”whether to show understanding, express interest, or guide the conversation. Avoid asking questions just for participation points, as they should always be thoughtful and relevant.

To practice, treat casual interactions like interviews, aiming to learn more about the other person. If you struggle with concise questioning, use tools like AI to refine your phrasing. Most importantly, listen actively before asking, as this fosters collaboration and strengthens relationships.
