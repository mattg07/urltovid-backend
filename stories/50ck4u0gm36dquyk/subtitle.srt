00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160

Communication expert Matt Abrahams

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,320
emphasizes that asking questions can elevate your status

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,440
and demonstrate empathy, care, and a willingness to learn.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,080
Effective leaders balance credibility with humility

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,840
and know how to ask the right questions

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,400
to strengthen relationships and advance their careers.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,680
Good questions should be concise,

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,000
build on previous conversation points,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,320
and focus on a specific idea.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,040
Before asking, consider your intention,

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,119
whether to show understanding, express interest,

13
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,959
or guide the conversation.

14
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:39,279
Avoid asking questions just for participation points,

15
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:42,320
as they should always be thoughtful and relevant.

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,599
To practice, treat casual interactions like interviews,

17
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:48,320
aiming to learn more about the other person.

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,439
If you struggle with concise questioning,

19
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:53,720
use tools like AI to refine your phrasing.

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,840
Most importantly, listen actively before asking

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,759
as this fosters collaboration and strengthens relationships.
