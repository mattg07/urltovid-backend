The U.S. election is critical for Ukraine's future aid. With funding fatigue setting in, both candidates, Trump and Harris, may struggle to maintain support. Ukrainian officials are anxious as they rely heavily on U.S. military and financial backing. A Trump win could mean reduced aid, while a Harris victory may still face congressional hurdles. The outcome will significantly impact Ukraine's ability to defend against Russia and its long-term recovery. Analysts warn that the election represents a pivotal moment for Ukraine's international support and stability.
